# Recommended SSL Settings for Nginx Sites
# ----------------------------------------

# Last Updated: 2019-07-04

# globalssl.conf
# Global ssl configuration file.
# Should be included in each and every server {} block of your https/ssl sites.
# Only use this if you know what you are doing with SSL, this is merely an example of 
# good SSL settings for nginx ssl sites.
# NO SUPPORT IS OFFERED IN THIS REPO FOR SETTING UP AND RUNNING SSL
# There is lots of help for Let's Encrypt at: https://community.letsencrypt.org/

# To use this set of rules, add the include below into each server block.
# add this at the very top of your HTTPS server blocks before any other location rules
# include /etc/nginx/ssl.d/globalssl.conf;

    # DIFFIE HELMAN ENCRYPTION / DHE
    ##

    # Diffie-Hellman parameter for DHE ciphersuites, recommended 4096 bits
    # Requires generating your dhparam.pem 
    # INSTRUCTIONS:
    # -------------
    # cd /etc/nginx/ssl
    # sudo openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 4096
    # WAIT FOR IT TO FINISH - Can take a long time

    # SSL CIPHERS 
    # -----------
    # Ciphers below are the strongest and most recommened set as of 2019-07-04 (cipher recommendations change regularly)
    # This is my own set of ciphers based on recommendations from https://www.immuniweb.com/ssl/
    # and https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
    # You can optionally use ciphers recommended by https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/
    # As we approach wider implementation and use of TLSv1.3 things will change even more
    # As of this version and writing - Nginx does not support TLSv1.3 yet
