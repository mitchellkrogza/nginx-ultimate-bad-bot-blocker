# EASY CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR STOPPING GOOGLE ANALYTICS "GHOST" SPAM

_______________
#### Version: V3.2017.07.757
#### Bad Referrer Count: 5444
#### Bad Bot Count: 499
____________________

Simply using the Nginx blocker does not stop Google Analytics ghost referral spam because they are hitting Analytics directly and not always necessarily touching your website. 

You should use regex filters in Analytics to prevent ghost referral spam.

For this there are several google-exclude-0*.txt files which have been created for you and they are updated at the same time when the Nginx Blocker is updated. As the list grows there will be more exclude files created.

## To stop Ghost Spam on On Analytics

Follow the step by step visual instructions below to add these google-exclude files as segments to your web site.

## Blocking Spam Referrer Domains Using Google Webmaster Tools (How to use google-disavow.txt file)

I have added the creation of a Google Disavow text file called google-disavow.txt. This file can be used in Google's Webmaster Tools to block all these domains out as spammy or bad links. Use with caution.
