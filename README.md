# EASY AUTO CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE NGINX BAD BOT BLOCKER
## Please follow the instructions below step by step :exclamation:

- This is our new preferred method of installation which is now done through a set of shell scripts contributed to this repo by Stuart Cardall @itoffshore who is one of the Alpine Linux package maintainers. 

- The instructions below are for a quick and painfree installation process which downloads all required files for the blocker and the scripts include adding the required includes to your nginx.conf and nginx .vhost files. The setup script assumes your vhost config files are located in /etc/nginx/sites-available/ and each vhost config file ends with a file extension of .vhost

- For manual installation instructions please see - Please see: https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/MANUAL-CONFIGURATION.md

- setup-ngxblocker, install-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker can all be configured with custom installation / update locations from the command line. **(See Step 11 of the instructions to show you how use these scripts and non-standard Nginx locations)**

- Run any of the setup, install or update scripts with --help or -h to view options.
************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-1.png"/>

Download install-ngxblocker to your /usr/sbin/directory and make the script executable.

```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/install-ngxblocker -O /usr/sbin/install-ngxblocker
sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/install-ngxblocker
```

If your Linux distribution does not have wget you can replace the wget command above using curl as follows:

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/install-ngxblocker -o /usr/sbin/install-ngxblocker
```

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-2.png"/>

Now run the install-ngxblocker script in DRY-MODE which will show you what changes it will make and what files it will download for you. This is only a DRY-RUN so no changes are being made yet. 

The install-ngxblocker downloads all required files including the setup and update scripts.

```
cd /usr/sbin
sudo ./install-ngxblocker
```

This will show you output as follows of the changes that will be made 
**(NOTE: this is only a DRY-RUN no changes have been made)**

```

```

All the required files have now been downloaded to the correct folders on Nginx for you direct from the repository.

**MAKE SURE you set your setup and update scripts to be executable by running the following two commands. This is important before continuing with Step 4 and onwards.**

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/setup-ngxblocker
sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/update-ngxblocker
```

**setup-ngxblocker, install-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker can all be configured with custom installation / update locations from the command line.** 

**Run any of the setup, install or update scripts with --help or -h to view options.**

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-4.png"/>

Now run the setup-ngxblocker script in DRY-MODE which will show you what changes it will make and what files it will download for you. This is only a DRY-RUN so no changes are being made yet.

```
cd /usr/sbin/
sudo ./setup-ngxblocker
```

This will give you output as follows (this output below assumes your nginx.conf file already has the default include of /etc/nginx/conf.d/*)
All Nginx installations I know of have this default include in the nginx.conf file distributed with all versions.

```
Checking url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/include_filelist.txt

** Dry Run ** | not updating files | run  as 'setup-ngxblocker -x' to setup files.

INFO:      /etc/nginx/conf.d/* detected               => /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf;  => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain2.com.vhost
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf;       => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain2.com.vhost
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf;  => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain1.com.vhost

Whitelisting ip:  x.x.x.x  => /etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf
```

This script also whitelists your IP in the whitelist-ips.conf file for you. 
Further IP's or IP ranges can be added to your customizable whitelits-ips.conf file located in /etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf.

**setup-ngxblocker, install-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker can all be configured with custom installation / update locations from the command line.** 

**Run any of the setup, install or update scripts with --help or -h to view options.**


************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-5.png"/>

Now run the setup script with the -x parameter to make all the necessary changes to your nginx.conf (if required) and also to add the required includes into all your vhost files. 

This setup-ngxblocker script assumes that all your vhost files located in /etc/nginx/sites-available end in an extension .vhost. It is good practice to make all your vhost config files end with a .vhost extension but if you prefer to stick what you already have eg .conf you can simply modify run setup-ngxblocker using the `-e` parameter to specify the extension you use for your vhost files.

For instance if your vhost files end in .conf you will change this execute setup-ngxblocker with an additional command line parameter as follows:

`sudo ./setup-ngxblocker -x -e conf`

So now let's run the setup script and let it make all the changes we need to make the Bot Blocker active on all your sites.

```
cd /usr/sbin/
sudo ./setup-ngxblocker -x
```

You will see output as follows:

```
Checking url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/include_filelist.txt

INFO:      /etc/nginx/conf.d/* detected               => /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf;  => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain2.com.vhost
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf;       => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain2.com.vhost
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf;  => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain1.com.vhost
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf;       => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain1.com.vhost

Whitelisting ip:  x.x.x.x  => /etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf
```

You will note it has done the includes in all the .vhost files on my test bed server and also whitelisted your own IP address in the whitelist-ips.conf file for you. Further IP's or IP ranges can be added to your customizable whitelits-ips.conf file located in /etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf.

What this setup script has done has simply added the following include statements into your .vhost files for you.

```
# Bad Bot Blocker
include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf;
include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf;
```

**setup-ngxblocker, install-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker can all be configured with custom installation / update locations from the command line.** 

**Run any of the setup, install or update scripts with --help or -h to view options.**

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-6.png"/>

Now test your nginx configuration

`sudo nginx -t`

and you should see

```
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-7.png"/>

Now simply reload / restart Nginx and the Bot Blocker will immediately be active and protecting all your web sites.

`sudo service nginx reload`

or

`sudo service nginx restart`

That's it, the blocker is now active and protecting your sites from thousands of malicious bots and domains.

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-8.png"/>

Now setup cron to automatically update the blocker for you every day so you always have the latest up to date protection.

`sudo crontab -e`

Add the following line at the end of your crontab file. Note adding the `-e` command line parameter to specify your email address where the update report is sent to. Obviously substitute `yourname@youremail.com` with your real email address or you will not receive the email when the script has updated.

`00 22 * * * sudo /usr/sbin/update-ngxblocker -e yourname@youremail.com` 

This will update the blocker every night for you at 10 PM.

If you want it to update more frequently (as sometimes I push out 3-4 updates a day) you can set it as follows to run the cron every 8 hours, although just once a day is more than enough.

`00 */8 * * * sudo /usr/sbin/update-ngxblocker -e yourname@youremail.com`       

If you don't want any email notification after an update (not advisable in case Nginx ever has an EMERG when reloading), then simply run your cron as follows. 

`00 */8 * * * sudo /usr/sbin/update-ngxblocker -n`       

That's it, the blocker will automatically keep itself up to date and also reload Nginx once it has downloaded the latest version of the globalblacklist.conf file.

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-9.png"/>

You can now customize any of the following files below to suit your environment or requirements. These include files never get modified during an update using the auto update script above so whatever customizations you do here will never be overwritten during an update.

```
/etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-domains.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/blacklist-user-agents.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/blacklist-ips.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/bad-referrer-words.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/custom-bad-referrers.conf
```

Let's say for some "obscure" reason you actually want to block GoogleBot from accessing your site. You would simply add it to the /etc/nginx/bots.d/blacklist-user-agents.conf file and it will over-ride the default whitelist for GoogleBot. the same applies to any other bots that are whitelisted by default.

All include files are commented for your convenience.

#### OPTIONAL
**INSTALLING THE BLOCKER TO NON-STANDARD NGINX FOLDER LOCATIONS**

Some people build Nginx themselves and do not end up having the standard nginx folder locations at `/etc/nginx`

For users like this you can run the install-ngblocker, setup-ngxblocker and update-ngblocker specifying your
folder location in the command lines as follows.

`sudo ./install-ngxblocker -x -c /usr/local/nginx/conf.d -b /usr/local/nginx/bots.d`

`sudo ./setup-ngxblocker -x -c /usr/local/nginx/conf.d -b /usr/local/nginx/bots.d`

`sudo ./update-ngxblocker -c /usr/local/nginx/conf.d -b /usr/local/nginx/bots.d -e yourname@youremail.com`

This will automatically put the files into the locations you specify, it will do the includes into your vhosts using your custom locations  and when update-ngblocker pulls a new update it will also now automatically re-write the "Include" sections inside the globalblacklist.conf file your own custom locations. Thanks again to Stuart Cardall @itoffshore for his contributions of these excellent scripts.

************************************************
## Welcome to the Ultimate Nginx Bad Bot, User-Agent, Spam Referrer Blocker, Adware, Malware and Ransomware Blocker, Click-Jacking Blocker, Click-Redirect Blocker and Bad IP Blocker with Anti DDOS System, Nginx Rate Limiting and Wordpress Theme Detector Blocking.

Bots attempt to make themselves look like other software or web sites by disguising their user agent.  Their user agent names may look harmless, perfectly legitimate even. 

For example, "^Java" but according to Project Honeypot, it's actually one of the most dangerous BUT a lot of legitimate bots out there have "Java" in their user agent string so the approach taken by many to block "Java" is not only ignorant but also blocking out very legitimate crawlers including some of Google's and Bing's and makes it very clear to me that those people writing bot blocking scripts seldom ever test them. 

Spam Referrers and Spam Domain Names use very clever techniques to hop off your sites running very lucrative click-jacking and click-redirecting campaigns which serve ads to unsuspecting people browsing the web or even planting malware, adware or ransomware into their browsers which then become part of their lucrative network of bots. 

This Bot Blocker includes hundreds of domain names and IP addresses that most people will not even see in their Nginx logs. This comes as a result of all my sites running of SSL and using Content-Security-Policy (CSP) which blocks things before they even get to Nginx and I have picked up and continue to pick up some of the worst domains and bots out there. 

A massive amount of Porn, Gambling and Fake News web sites are also blocked in this blocker script which also grows at a rapid pace.

Unfortunately most bot blocker scripts out there are simply copy and pasted from other people's scripts and made  to look like their own work. This one  was inspired by the one created by https://github.com/mariusv and I  contributed to that project but went off into a totally new layout, cleaned it up big time and started from scratch. It is now a completely independent project. It's clean, it works and has been thoroughly tested.

************************************************
### THE BASICS

This nginx bad bot bot blocker list is designed to be a global Nginx include file and uses the Nginx map $http_user_agent, map $http_referer and geo $validate_client directives.

This way the .conf file is loaded once into memory by Nginx and is available to all web sites that you operate. You simply need to use an Include statement in an Nginx vhost conf file.

************************************************
### IT'S CENTRALISED:

The beauty of this is that it is one central file used by all your web sites. This means there is only place to make amendments ie. adding new bots that you discover in your log files. Any changes are applied immediately to all sites after a simple "sudo service nginx reload". But of course always do a sudo nginx -t to test any config changes before you reload.

************************************************
### IT IS TINY AND LIGHTWEIGHT

The file is tiny in size. At the time of this writing and the first public commit of this the file size including all the commenting "which nginx ignores" currently at **a mere 185 kb in size** and already containing over 5000 bad domains, bad bots and bad IP addresses. It is so lightweight that Nginx does not even know it's there. It already contains thousands of entries - total updated at the top of this README. 

************************************************
### IT IS ACCURATE AND IS FALSE POSITIVE PROOF

Unlike many other bad bot blockers out there for Nginx and Apache where people simply copy and paste lists from others, this list has been built from the ground up and tested thoroughly and I mean thoroughly for now over 10 months. It comes from actual server logs that are monitored daily and there are at least 3-10 new additions to this file almost daily.

It has also been throughly tested for false positives using months of constant and regular testing and monitoring of log files. 

All web sites listed in the bad referers are checked one by one before they are even added. Simply copying  anything that look suspicious in your log file and adding it to a blocker like this without actually seeing  what it is first .... well it's foolish to say the least.

************************************************
### DROP THEM AND THAT'S IT

Nginx has a lovely error called 444 which just literally drops the connection. All these rules issue a 444 response so if a rule matches, the requesting IP simply get's no response and it would appear that your  server does not exist to them or appears to be offline. 

A test with curl using one of the test command line's documented in the /conf.d/globalblacklist.conf file will give a simple "curl: (52) Empty reply from server" and that's the reply the bad referrers and bots get.

************************************************
### RATE LIMITING FUNCTIONALITY BUILT IN

For bot's or spiders that you still want to allow but want to limit their visitation rate, you can use the  built in rate limiting functions I have included. The file is extensively commented throughout so you should figure it out otherwise simply message me if you are having problems.

## FEATURES OF THE NGINX BAD BOT BLOCKER:

- Extensive Lists of Bad and Known Bad Bots and Scrapers (updated almost daily)
- Blocking of Spam Referrer Domains and Web Sites
- Blocking of SEO data collection companies like Semalt.com, Builtwith.com, WooRank.com and many others (updated regularly)
- Blocking of clickjacking Sites linked to Adware, Malware and Ransomware
- Blocking of Porn and Gambling Web Sites who use Lucrative Ways to Earn Money through Serving Ads by hopping off your domain names and web sites.
- Blocking of Bad Domains and IP's that you cannot even see in your Nginx Logs. Thanks to the Content Security Policy (CSP) on all my SSL sites I can see things trying to pull resources off my sites before they even get to Nginx and get blocked by the CSP.
- Anti DDOS Filter and Rate Limiting of Agressive Bots
- Alphabetically ordered for easier maintenance (Pull Requests Welcomed)
- Commented sections of certain important bots to be sure of before blocking
- Includes the IP range of Cyveillance who are known to ignore robots.txt rules
  and snoop around all over the Internet.
- Whitelisting of Google, Bing and Cloudflare IP Ranges
- Whitelisting of your own IP Ranges that you want to avoid blocking by mistake.
- Ability to add other IP ranges and IP blocks that you want to block out.
- If its out there and it's bad it's already in here and BLOCKED !!

************************************************
### UNDERSTANDS PUNYCODE / IDN DOMAIN NAMES

A lot of lists out there put funny domains into their hosts file. Your hosts file and DNS will not understand this. This list uses converted domains which are in the correct DNS format to be understood by any operating system. **Avoid using lists** that do not put the correctly formatted domain structure into their lists.

For instance
The domain:

`lifehacĸer.com` (note the K)

actually translates to:

`xn--lifehacer-1rb.com`

You can do an nslookup on any operating system and it will resolve correctly.

`nslookup xn--lifehacer-1rb.com`

```xn--lifehacer-1rb.com
	origin = dns1.yandex.net
	mail addr = iskalko.yandex.ru
	serial = 2016120703
	refresh = 14400
	retry = 900
	expire = 1209600
	minimum = 14400
xn--lifehacer-1rb.com	mail exchanger = 10 mx.yandex.net.
Name:	xn--lifehacer-1rb.com
Address: 78.110.60.230
xn--lifehacer-1rb.com	nameserver = dns2.yandex.net.
xn--lifehacer-1rb.com	text = "v=spf1 redirect=_spf.yandex.net"
xn--lifehacer-1rb.com	nameserver = dns1.yandex.net.
```

- Look at: https://www.charset.org/punycode for more info on this.

************************************************
## ALWAYS MONITOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING:

**MAKE SURE to monitor your web site logs** after implementing this. I suggest you first load this into one site and monitor it for any possible false positives before putting this into production on all your web sites.

Do not sit like an ostrich with your head in the sand, being a responsible server operator and web site owner means you must monitor your logs frequently. A reason many of you ended up here in the first place because you saw nasty looking stuff in your Nginx log files.
 
Also monitor your logs daily for new bad referers and user-agent strings that you want to block. Your best source of adding to this list is your own server logs, not mine.
 
Feel free to contribute bad referers from your own logs to this project by sending a Pull Request (PR). You can however rely on this list to keep out 99% of the baddies out there.
 
************************************************
## HOW TO MONITOR YOUR LOGS DAILY (The Easy Way):

**With great thanks and appreciation to**

https://blog.nexcess.net/2011/01/21/one-liners-for-apache-log-files/

To monitor your top referer's for a web site's log file's on a daily basis use the following simple cron jobs which will email you a list of top referer's / user agents every morning from a particular web site's log files. This is an example for just one cron job for one site. Set up multiple one's for each one you want to monitor. Here is a cron that runs at 8am every morning and emails me the stripped down log of referers. When I say stripped down, the domain of the site and other referers like Google and Bing are stripped from the results. Of course you must change the log file name, domain name and your email address in the examples below. The second cron for collecting User agents does not do any stripping out of any referers but you can add that functionality if you like copying the awk statement !~ from the first example.

##### Cron for Monitoring Daily Referers on Nginx

`00 08 * * * tail -10000 /var/log/nginx/mydomain-access.log | awk '$11 !~ /google|bing|yahoo|yandex|mywebsite.com/' | awk '{print $11}' | tr -d '"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -1000 | mail -s "Top 1000 Referers for Mydomain.com" me@mydomain.com`

This emails you a daily list of referrers using an awk command to exclude domains like google, bing and your own domain name.

##### Cron for Monitoring Daily User Agents on Nginx

`00 08 * * * tail -50000 /var/log/nginx/mydomain-access.log | awk '{print $12}' | tr -d '"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -1000 | mail -s "Top 1000 Agents for Mydomain.com" me@mydomain.com`

This emails you a list of top User-Agents who visited your site in the last 24 hours, helpful for spotting any rogue or suspicious looking User-Agents strings.

************************************************
## BLOCK AGGRESSIVE BOTS AT FIREWALL LEVEL USING FAIL2BAN:

I have added a custom Fail2Ban filter and action that I have written which monitors your Nginx logs for bots that generate a large number of 444 errors. This custom jail for Fail2Ban will scan logs over a 1 week period and ban the offender for 24 hours.
It helps a great deal in keeping out some repeat offenders and preventing them from filling up your log files with 444 errors.
See the Fail2Ban folder for instructions on configuring this great add on for the Nginx Bad Bot Blocker.

************************************************
## STOPPING GOOGLE ANALYTICS "GHOST" SPAM:

Simply using the Nginx blocker does not stop Google Analytics ghost referral spam because they are hitting Analytics directly and not always necessarily touching your website. 

You should use regex filters in Analytics to prevent ghost referral spam.

For this there are several google-exclude-0*.txt files which have been created for you and they are updated at the same time when the Nginx Blocker is updated. As the list grows there will be more exclude files created.

************************************************
## TO STOP "GHOST" SPAM ON GOOGLE ANALYTICS FOLLOW THE SIMPLE VISUAL GUIDE BELOW

Follow the step by step visual instructions below to add these google-exclude files as segments to your web site.

## BLOCKING SPAM DOMAINS USING GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE / WEBMASTER TOOLS 
(How to use the google-disavow.txt file)

I have added the creation of a Google Disavow text file called google-disavow.txt. This file can be used in Google's Webmaster Tools to block all these domains out as spammy or bad links. Use with caution.

************************************************
## ROBOTS.txt VERSION for those who cannot use this full blocker?

Lots of people are at the peril of their hosting company and do not have root access to the server running behind their web site. If this is your situation check out the automatically generated robots.txt file which will help you to some degree to keep a lot of Bad Bots and User-Agents out of your sites.

************************************************
## .htaccess VERSIONS for those who cannot use this full blocker?

Lots of people are at the peril of their hosting company and do not have root access to the server running behind their web site. 

If this is your situation check out the automatically generated .htaccess versions of the Spam Referrer Blocker which can be found in <a href="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/tree/master/.htaccess">this repository</a> this .htaccess method (FOR APACHE SITES ONLY) will help you to keep all the Spam Referrers in this blocker out of your site. 

This is merely mentioned here as a lot of people using CPanel systems think they are sitting behind an Nginx server but in reality are actually running on an Apache Server sitting behind an Nginx Proxy Server. .htaccess does not work on Nginx sites.

Not Using Nginx Web Server? See the [![Get the APACHE ULTIMATE BAD BOT BLOCKER](https://img.shields.io/badge/APACHE%20-%20ULTIMATE%20BAD%20BOT%20BLOCKER%20%E2%9B%94-blue.svg)](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker)
