- This is a copy of an entire /etc/nginx folder from an Engintron/cPanel/WHM configuration.

- This is merely an example of where to put the required includes into your hosts files.

- **Do not simply copy and paste this over your entire nginx folder**, use it as a guide only as it requires that you put the correct domain names into your hosts config's and also correct certificate locations.

- PLEASE Follow the main configuration instructions at https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md

- If you follow the main configuration instructions all you need to to is make the changes required in your /etc/conf.d/default.conf and /etc/conf.d/default_https.conf files as per this example.

- This example contains a modified file in **/utilities/https_vhosts.php** which will do the includes for you on any SSL vhosts you create.
