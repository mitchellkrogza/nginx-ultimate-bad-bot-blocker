## Please follow the instructions below step by step :exclamation:

- This is our new preferred method of installation which is now done through a set of shell scripts contributed to this repo by Stuart Cardall @itoffshore who is one of the Alpine Linux package maintainers. 

- The instructions below are for a quick and painfree installation process which downloads all required files for the blocker and the scripts include adding the required includes to your nginx.conf and nginx .vhost files. The setup script assumes your vhost config files are located in /etc/nginx/sites-available/ and each vhost config file ends with a file extension of .vhost

- For manual installation instructions please see - Please see: https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/MANUAL-CONFIGURATION.md

- setup-ngxblocker, install-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker can all be configured with custom installation / update locations from the command line. **(See Step 11 of the instructions to show you how use these scripts and non-standard Nginx locations)**

- Run any of the setup, install or update scripts with --help or -h to view options.
************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-1.png"/>

Download install-ngxblocker to your /usr/sbin/directory and make the script executable.

```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/install-ngxblocker -O /usr/sbin/install-ngxblocker
sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/install-ngxblocker
```

If your Linux distribution does not have wget you can replace the wget command above using curl as follows:

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/install-ngxblocker -o /usr/sbin/install-ngxblocker
```

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-2.png"/>

Now run the install-ngxblocker script in DRY-MODE which will show you what changes it will make and what files it will download for you. This is only a DRY-RUN so no changes are being made yet. 

The install-ngxblocker downloads all required files including the setup and update scripts.

```
cd /usr/sbin
sudo ./install-ngxblocker
```

This will show you output as follows of the changes that will be made 
**(NOTE: this is only a DRY-RUN no changes have been made)**

```

```

All the required files have now been downloaded to the correct folders on Nginx for you direct from the repository.

**MAKE SURE you set your setup and update scripts to be executable by running the following two commands. This is important before continuing with Step 4 and onwards.**

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/setup-ngxblocker
sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/update-ngxblocker
```

**setup-ngxblocker, install-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker can all be configured with custom installation / update locations from the command line.** 

**Run any of the setup, install or update scripts with --help or -h to view options.**

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-4.png"/>

Now run the setup-ngxblocker script in DRY-MODE which will show you what changes it will make and what files it will download for you. This is only a DRY-RUN so no changes are being made yet.

```
cd /usr/sbin/
sudo ./setup-ngxblocker
```

This will give you output as follows (this output below assumes your nginx.conf file already has the default include of /etc/nginx/conf.d/*)
All Nginx installations I know of have this default include in the nginx.conf file distributed with all versions.

```
Checking url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/include_filelist.txt

** Dry Run ** | not updating files | run  as 'setup-ngxblocker -x' to setup files.

INFO:      /etc/nginx/conf.d/* detected               => /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf;  => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain2.com.vhost
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf;       => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain2.com.vhost
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf;  => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain1.com.vhost
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf;       => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain1.com.vhost

Whitelisting ip:  x.x.x.x  => /etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf
```

This script also whitelists your IP in the whitelist-ips.conf file for you. 
Further IP's or IP ranges can be added to your customizable whitelits-ips.conf file located in /etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf.

**setup-ngxblocker, install-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker can all be configured with custom installation / update locations from the command line.** 

**Run any of the setup, install or update scripts with --help or -h to view options.**


************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-5.png"/>

Now run the setup script with the -x parameter to make all the necessary changes to your nginx.conf (if required) and also to add the required includes into all your vhost files. 

This setup-ngxblocker script assumes that all your vhost files located in /etc/nginx/sites-available end in an extension .vhost. It is good practice to make all your vhost config files end with a .vhost extension but if you prefer to stick what you already have eg .conf you can simply modify run setup-ngxblocker using the `-e` parameter to specify the extension you use for your vhost files.

For instance if your vhost files end in .conf you will change this execute setup-ngxblocker with an additional command line parameter as follows:

`sudo ./setup-ngxblocker -x -e conf`

So now let's run the setup script and let it make all the changes we need to make the Bot Blocker active on all your sites.

```
cd /usr/sbin/
sudo ./setup-ngxblocker -x
```

You will see output as follows:

```
Checking url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/include_filelist.txt

INFO:      /etc/nginx/conf.d/* detected               => /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf;  => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain2.com.vhost
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf;       => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain2.com.vhost
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf;  => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain1.com.vhost
inserting: include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf;       => /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain1.com.vhost

Whitelisting ip:  x.x.x.x  => /etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf
```

You will note it has done the includes in all the .vhost files on my test bed server and also whitelisted your own IP address in the whitelist-ips.conf file for you. Further IP's or IP ranges can be added to your customizable whitelits-ips.conf file located in /etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf.

What this setup script has done has simply added the following include statements into your .vhost files for you.

```
# Bad Bot Blocker
include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf;
include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf;
```

**setup-ngxblocker, install-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker can all be configured with custom installation / update locations from the command line.** 

**Run any of the setup, install or update scripts with --help or -h to view options.**

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-6.png"/>

Now test your nginx configuration

`sudo nginx -t`

and you should see

```
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-7.png"/>

Now simply reload / restart Nginx and the Bot Blocker will immediately be active and protecting all your web sites.

`sudo service nginx reload`

or

`sudo service nginx restart`

That's it, the blocker is now active and protecting your sites from thousands of malicious bots and domains.

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-8.png"/>

Now setup cron to automatically update the blocker for you every day so you always have the latest up to date protection.

`sudo crontab -e`

Add the following line at the end of your crontab file. Note adding the `-e` command line parameter to specify your email address where the update report is sent to. Obviously substitute `yourname@youremail.com` with your real email address or you will not receive the email when the script has updated.

`00 22 * * * sudo /usr/sbin/update-ngxblocker -e yourname@youremail.com` 

This will update the blocker every night for you at 10 PM.

If you want it to update more frequently (as sometimes I push out 3-4 updates a day) you can set it as follows to run the cron every 8 hours, although just once a day is more than enough.

`00 */8 * * * sudo /usr/sbin/update-ngxblocker -e yourname@youremail.com`       

If you don't want any email notification after an update (not advisable in case Nginx ever has an EMERG when reloading), then simply run your cron as follows. 

`00 */8 * * * sudo /usr/sbin/update-ngxblocker -n`       

That's it, the blocker will automatically keep itself up to date and also reload Nginx once it has downloaded the latest version of the globalblacklist.conf file.

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-9.png"/>

You can now customize any of the following files below to suit your environment or requirements. These include files never get modified during an update using the auto update script above so whatever customizations you do here will never be overwritten during an update.

```
/etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-domains.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/blacklist-user-agents.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/blacklist-ips.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/bad-referrer-words.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/custom-bad-referrers.conf
```

Let's say for some "obscure" reason you actually want to block GoogleBot from accessing your site. You would simply add it to the /etc/nginx/bots.d/blacklist-user-agents.conf file and it will over-ride the default whitelist for GoogleBot. the same applies to any other bots that are whitelisted by default.

All include files are commented for your convenience.

`curl -I http://yourdomain.com -e http://100dollars-seo.com`

`curl -I http://yourdomain.com -e http://zx6.ru`

**Should respond with: curl: (52) Empty reply from server**

The Nginx Ultimate Bot Blocker is now WORKING and PROTECTING your web sites !!!

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-11.png"/>

#### OPTIONAL
**INSTALLING THE BLOCKER TO NON-STANDARD NGINX FOLDER LOCATIONS**

Some people build Nginx themselves and do not end up having the standard nginx folder locations at `/etc/nginx`

For users like this you can run the install-ngblocker, setup-ngxblocker and update-ngblocker specifying your
folder location in the command lines as follows.

`sudo ./install-ngxblocker -x -c /usr/local/nginx/conf.d -b /usr/local/nginx/bots.d`

`sudo ./setup-ngxblocker -x -c /usr/local/nginx/conf.d -b /usr/local/nginx/bots.d`

`sudo ./update-ngxblocker -c /usr/local/nginx/conf.d -b /usr/local/nginx/bots.d -e yourname@youremail.com`

This will automatically put the files into the locations you specify, it will do the includes into your vhosts using your custom locations  and when update-ngblocker pulls a new update it will also now automatically re-write the "Include" sections inside the globalblacklist.conf file your own custom locations. Thanks again to Stuart Cardall @itoffshore for his contributions of these excellent scripts.
