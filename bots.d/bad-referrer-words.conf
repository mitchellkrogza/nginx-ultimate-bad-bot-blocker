# This is merely an example and gets auto included as since Version 2.2017.07 introduced on 2017-04-20
# This file must exist on your system or Nginx will fail a reload due to a missing file
# For all intensive purpose you can delete everything inside this file and leave it
# completely blank if you do not want your Nginx Blocker to include scanning for bad words within urls or referrer string
# Only add one entry per line

# *******************************
# !!! WARNING WARNING WARNING !!!
# *******************************

# ***************************************
# PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL HOW YOU USE THIS
# ***************************************
# Here is an example of how one supposed bad word can cause your whole site to go down.
# An issue was logged where the users own domain name was specialisteparquet.com
# Because this list contained the word "cialis" it was detected within his domain name causing 
# his entire site to go down and not server any assets.
# That one entry would even cause any site containing a word like "specialist" anywhere in any
# of their sites pages to cause them to be blocked and whitelisting your own domain name in the
# whitelist-domains.conf file will not even bypass this, SO BE CAREFUL PLEASE

# Think very carefully before you add any word here

# *****************************************************************************************
# PLEASE MAKE SURE that you use word regex boundaries to avoid false positive detection !!!
# *****************************************************************************************

# BY DEFAULT ALL THE EXAMPLES BELOW ARE COMMENTED OUT AND HENCE NOT ENABLED

# As you can see in the examples below the word "adultgalls" is entered with a preceding \b and an ending \b
# this makes it now "\badultgalls\b". It is crucial to use the word boundaries regex formatting. 

# ---------
# EXAMPLES:
# ---------
#	"~*(?:\b)adultgalls(?:\b|)"						1;
#	"~*(?:\b)amateurxpass(?:\b|)"					1;
#	"~*(?:\b)bigblackbooty(?:\b|)"					1;
#	"~*(?:\b)blacktits(?:\b|)"						1;
#	"~*(?:\b)cookie\-law\-enforcement(?:\b|)"		1;
#	"~*(?:\b)free\-share\-buttons(?:\b|)"			1;
#	"~*(?:\b)free\-social\-buttons(?:\b|)"			1;
#	"~*(?:\b)fuck\-paid\-share\-buttons(?:\b|)"		1;
#	"~*(?:\b)ilovevitaly(?:\b|)"					1;
#	"~*(?:\b)law\-enforcement\-bot(?:\b|)"			1;
#	"~*(?:\b)law\-enforcement\-check(?:\b|)"		1;
#	"~*(?:\b)share\-buttons\-for\-free(?:\b|)"		1;
#	"~*(?:\b)webfuck(?:\b|)"						1;
#	"~*(?:\b)xxxrus(?:\b|)"							1;
#	"~*(?:\b)zeroredirect(?:\b|)"					1;
