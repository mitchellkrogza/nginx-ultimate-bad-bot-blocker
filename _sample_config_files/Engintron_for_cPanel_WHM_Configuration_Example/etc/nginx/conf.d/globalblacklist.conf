### THE ULTIMATE NGINX BAD BOT BLOCKER
### **********************************

### VERSION INFORMATION #
###################################################
### Version: V3.2017.06.627
### VERSION INFORMATION ##

### This file implements a checklist / blacklist for good user agents, bad user agents and
### bad referrers. It also has whitelisting for your own IP's and known good IP Ranges
### and also has rate limiting functionality for bad bots who you only want to rate limit
### and not actually block out entirely. It is powerful and also flexible.

### Created By: https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/
### Repo Url: https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker
### Copyright Mitchell Krog - <mitchellkrog@gmail.com>

### Tested on: nginx/1.10.3 (Ubuntu 16.04)

### This list was developed and is in use on a live Nginx server running some very busy web sites.
### It was built from the ground up using real data from daily logs and is updated almost daily.
### It has been extensively tested for false positives and all additions to the lists of bad user agents,
### spam referers, rogue IP address, scanners, scrapers and domain hijacking sites are extensively checked
### before they are added. It is monitored extensively for any false positives.

### *********
### Features:
### *********
###	Clear formatting for Ease of Maintenance.
###	Alphabetically ordered lists for Ease of Maintenance.
###	Extensive Commenting for Ease of Reference.
###	Extensive bad_bot list
###	Extensive bad_referer list (please excuse the nasty words and domains)
###	Simple regex patterns versus complicated messy regex patterns.
###	Checks regardless of http / https urls or the lack of any protocol sent.
###	IP range blocking / whitelisting.
###	Rate Limiting Functions.

### *** PLEASE READ ALL INLINE NOTES ON TESTING !!!!

###	I have this set up as an include in nginx.conf as
###	Include /etc/nginx/conf.d/globalblacklist.conf
###	This is loaded and available for any vhost to use in its config
###	Each vhost then just needs the include file mentioned below for it to take effect.

### In Most cases your nginx.conf should already have an include statement as follows
### Include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*
### If that is the case then you can ignore the above include statement as Nginx will 
### load anything in the conf.d folder and make it available to all sites.

### All you then need to do is use the include statements below in the server {} block of a vhost file for it to take effect.
# 	server {
#			#Config stuff here
#			include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf
#			include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf
#			#Other config stuff here
#		 }

###	Need I say, please don't just copy and paste this without reviewing what bots and
###	referers are being blocked, you may want to exclude certain of them
###	Also make SURE to whitelist your own IP's in the geo $bad_referer section.
###	Know why you are using this or why you want to use it before you do, the implications
###	are quite severe.

###	*** PLEASE READ INLINE NOTES ON TESTING !!!!

###	Note that: 
###	0 = allowed - no limits
###	1 = allowed or rate limited less restrictive
###	2 = rate limited more
###	3 = block completely

###	NEED I say do a "sudo nginx -t" to test the config is okay after adding these
###	and if so then "sudo service nginx reload" for it to take effect.

### *** MAKE SURE TO ADD to your nginx.conf ***
### server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
### server_names_hash_max_size 4096;
### limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=flood:50m rate=90r/s;
### limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:50m;
### to allow it to load this large set of domains into memory and to set the rate limiting zones for the DDOS filter.

### ADDING YOUR OWN BAD REFERERS
### Fork your own local copy and then
### Send a Pull Request by following the instructions in the Pull_Requests_Here_Please folder.


# *********************************
# FIRST BLOCK BY USER-AGENT STRINGS
# *********************************

# ***************
# PLEASE TEST !!!
# ***************

# ALWAYS test any User-Agent Strings you add here to make sure you have it right
# Use a Chrome Extension called "User-Agent Switcher for Chrome" where you can create your
# own custom lists of User-Agents and test them easily against your rules below.

# You can also use Curl to test user-agents as per example below
# curl -I http://www.yourdomain.com -A "GoogleBot"  << 200 OK
# curl -I http://www.yourdomain.com -A "80legs"  <<< 444 Dropped Connection

# Here we also allow specific User Agents to come through that we want to allow

# PLEASE NOTE: In all lists below I use Nginx case-insensitive matching ~* 
# This means regardless of how you type the word, upper or lowercase or mixed it will
# be detected by Nginx Regex. Some Names are Capitalised simply for Ease of Reading.
# Especially important for both Googlebot and googlebot to be allowed through no?

# Now we map all good and bad user agents to a variable called $bad_bot

map $http_user_agent $bad_bot {

	default		0;

# ***********************************************
# Include your Own Custom List of Bad User Agents
# ***********************************************
# use the include file below to further customize your own list of additional
# user-agents you wish to permanently block

# START BLACKLISTED USER AGENTS ### DO NOT EDIT THIS LINE AT ALL ###

# **************************************************
# User-Agent Strings Allowed Throug but Rate Limited
# **************************************************
# Some people block libwww-perl, it us widely used in many valid (non rogue) agents
# I allow libwww-perl as I use it for monitoring systems with Munin but it is rate limited

# ****************************************
# SECOND BLOCK BY REFERER STRINGS AND URLS
# ****************************************

# Add here all referrer words and URL's that are to blocked.

# *****************
# PLEASE TEST !!!!
# *****************

# ALWAYS test referers that you add. This is done manually as follows

# curl -I http://www.yourdomain.com -e http://anything.adcash.com
# curl -I http://www.yourdomain.com -e http://www.goodwebsite.com/not-adcash
# curl -I http://www.yourdomain.com -e http://www.betterwebsite.com/not/adcash

# This uses curl to send the referer string to your site and you should see an immediate
# 403 Forbidden Error or No Response at all if you use the 444 error like I do.

# Because of case-insensitive matching any combination of capitilization in the names
# will all produce a positive hit - make sure you always test thoroughly and monitor logs
# This also does NOT check for a preceding www. nor does it check for it ending in .com
# .net .org or any long string attached at the end. It also does not care if the referer
# was sent with http https or even ftp.

# REAL WORLD EXAMPLE
# *******************
# If you were a photographer like me and say took a photo of a "girl" and you then posted
# a blog showing everyone your new photo and your blog slug / permalink was
# http://www.mysite.com/blog/photo-of-girl/
# You can go and monitor your logs and you will see lots of 444 from other pages on your
# site that have been clicked on sending that page as a referer so in the example below
# you will generate a 403 error.

# curl --referer http://www.mysite.com/blog/photo-of-girl/ http://www.mysite.com/
 
# So please be careful with these and think carefully before you add new words.
# Remember we are trying to keep out the general riff-raff not kill your web sites.

# **********************************************************************
# Now we map all bad referer words below to a variable called $bad_words
# **********************************************************************

map $http_referer $bad_words {
    default 0;

# *************************
# Bad Referer Word Scanning
# *************************

# These are Words and Terms often found tagged onto domains or within url query strings.
# Create and Customize Your Own Bad Referrer Words Here using the new Include File Method
  # New Method Uses the include file below so that when pulling future updates your
  # customized list of bad referrer words are automatically now included for you
  # Read Comments inside bad-referrer-words.conf for customization tips.
  # Updating the main globalblacklist.conf file will not touch your custom include files

# START CUSTOM BAD REFERRER WORDS ### DO NOT EDIT THIS LINE AT ALL ###
	include /etc/nginx/bots.d/bad-referrer-words.conf;
# END CUSTOM BAD REFERRER WORDS ### DO NOT EDIT THIS LINE AT ALL ###

}

# ************************
# Bad Referer Domain Names
# ************************

# Now a list of bad referer urls these domains or any combination of them ie .com .net
# will be blocked out. Doesn't matter if the protocol is http, https or even ftp

# This section includes:
# **********************
# Blocking of SEO company Semalt.com (now merged into this one section)
# MIRAI Botnet Domains Used for Mass Attacks
# Other known bad SEO companies and Ad Hijacking Sites  
# Sites linked to malware, adware, clickjacking and ransomware

# *****************
# PLEASE TEST !!!!
# *****************

# ALWAYS test referers that you add. This is done manually as follows

# curl -I http://www.yourdomain.com -e http://8gold.com

# This uses curl to send the referer string to your site and you should see an immediate
# 403 Forbidden Error or No Response at all if you use the 444 error like I do.

# Because of case-insensitive matching any combination of capitilization 
# will all produce a positive hit - make sure you always test.

# curl -I http://www.yourdomain.com -e http://NOT-8gold.com
# curl -I http://www.yourdomain.com -e http://this.is.not8gOlD.net
# curl -I http://www.yourdomain.com -e ftp://8gold.com
# curl -I http://www.yourdomain.com -e ftp://www.weare8gold.NET
# curl -I http://www.yourdomain.com -e https://subdomain.8gold.com
# curl -I http://www.yourdomain.com -e https://NOT8GolD.org

# This works exactly like the bad referer word lists above and is very strict !!!
# I have gone for the simple stricter approach which blocks all variants for those
# who just hop out and but another domain name.

# So if you see a bad referer from wearegoogle.com and you want to block them just add
# them as "~*wearegoogle.com" don't ever go and do something like "~*google(-|.)" you will
# kill all your SEO in a week. Rather also send a Pull Request by following the instructions
# in the Pull_Requests_Here_Please folder.

# I also include any sites that hotlink images from my sites into the list below.
# There are hundreds of image stealing sites out there so this list WILL grow now doubt.


# ***********************************************************************
# Now we map all good & bad referer urls to variable called #bad_referer
# ***********************************************************************
