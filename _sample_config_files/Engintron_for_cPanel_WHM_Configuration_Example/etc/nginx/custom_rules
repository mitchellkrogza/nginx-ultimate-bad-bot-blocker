# Some examples:
# - Engintron & CloudFlare
# - HTTP to HTTPS redirects when using CloudFlare
# - Setting up domains with dedicated IPs on the system
# - Cache exclusions for domains, subdomains or even directories
# - Any other global or domain specific rule (redirect, process etc.)

# === FOR USE WITH CLOUDFLARE ===
#
# a) If your server has a single shared IP ONLY and you wish to use CloudFlare for any (or all) of your sites
#    you will have to specify this shared IP address below otherwise you'll get errors from CloudFlare.
#    This change will simply tell Nginx to skip DNS resolving and simply forward traffic to the shared IP.
#    Uncomment the following line if all your sites on the shared (main) IP of your server are on CloudFlare:
#
# set $PROXY_DOMAIN_OR_IP "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"; # Use your cPanel's shared IP address here
#
# b) If you utilize CloudFlare on a cPanel server with BOTH a shared IP and dedicated IPs for domains, you will
#    have to set the IP ONLY for each such domain at the "WHEN TO SPECIFY A DOMAIN IP" section lower in this file.
#
# c) It is possible to force-redirect all your domains on CloudFlare to HTTPS if you have TLS/SSL enabled
#    in CloudFlare's "Crypto" settings page. Make sure you use "Flexible SSL" there so CloudFlare proxies
#    traffic from HTTPS to Nginx's HTTP port (80). This way you'll also be able to serve sites over HTTPS with
#    no actual TLS/SSL certificate installed on the server, as long as they exist in CloudFlare and have
#    CloudFlare's shared TLS/SSL certificate enabled there. To redirect to HTTPS, simply specify a block similar
#    to the one below and make sure you set the domains you DO NOT want to automatically redirect to HTTPS.
#
# # === Protocol redirect handling when using CloudFlare [start] ===
#
# set $redirToSSL "";
# if ($http_cf_visitor ~ '{"scheme":"http"}') {
#     set $redirToSSL "on";
# }
#
# # Set each domain you DO NOT want to automatically redirect to HTTPS when using CloudFlare only below
# # and repeat the process with additional "if" blocks for more domains
#
# if ($host ~ 'domain-to-exclude-from-redirect.com') {
#     set $redirToSSL "off";
# }
# if ($redirToSSL = "on") {
#     return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
# }
#
# # === Protocol redirect handling when using CloudFlare [finish] ===



# === WHEN TO SPECIFY A DOMAIN IP ===
# By default, Nginx will redirect requests to the right domain IP by using DNS resolving.
# However there are cases where you want to specify an IP for use with Nginx:
# - When you use CloudFlare for certain domains only on your server,
#   regardless of whether these domains use the server's shared IP or a dedicated IP.
# - When you are working on a domain which does not yet (DNS) resolve to your server,
#   but you want to access it by modifying your computer's "hosts" file.
#
# To specify the domain IP in such cases, simply enter a domain or subdomain in an "if" block
# (as shown below) and inside that block set the appropriate shared or dedicated IP to point to.
#
# To specify the IP for a domain simply uncomment the following 3 lines and make sure you replace
# example.com with your actual domain or subdomain and also replace XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX with the actual
# IP assigned to that domain. To specify the IP for more domains, simply copy that "if" block
# (per domain) and change accordingly.
#
# if ($host ~ "example.com") {
#     set $PROXY_DOMAIN_OR_IP "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX";
# }



# === DOMAIN AND URL PATH EXCLUSIONS FROM CACHING ===
# If you wish to exclude certain domains, subdomains or even full URL paths from micro-caching and/or
# static file caching, simply specify them below and use a colon (|) character as a separator.
# Remember that if you specify a "naked" domain name, e.g. mynicedomain.com, every subdomain e.g.
# support.mynicedomain.com will also be excluded from caching. Decide wisely!
# If you wish to disable ONLY micro-caching, then comment the line "set $CACHE_BYPASS_FOR_STATIC".
# If you wish to disable ONLY static file caching, then comment the line "set $CACHE_BYPASS_FOR_DYNAMIC".
#
# Note: Don't include the "http(s)://" portion of a URL.
#
 if ($SITE_URI ~* "website1.com|website2.com/login|") {
     set $CACHE_BYPASS_FOR_DYNAMIC 1; # Disables micro-caching
#     set $CACHE_BYPASS_FOR_STATIC 1; # Disables static file caching
